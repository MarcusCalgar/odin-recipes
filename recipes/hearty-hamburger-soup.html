    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hamburger soup recipe is a stick-to-your-ribs thick and hearty dish, both filling and very good. Easy and quick to make as well. A family favorite in our house! Serve with fresh biscuits.</p>
    <p>We loved this soup! It's very easy to make, especially when you throw it all into the crockpot. I cooked it on high for 2 hours then turned it down to low for another 6...thanks for the great recipe!</p>
