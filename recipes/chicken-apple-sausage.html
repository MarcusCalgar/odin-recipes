    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great cold weather meal, although it's delicious anytime of the year.</p>
    <p>This was a wonderful Fall recipe! I used regular potatoes (didn't have the Yukons) peeled and cut and simmered with apple cider.
         It was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great, much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut. 
         After reading other reviews, it seems some have misread the recipe, using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider. Yikes, no wonder they did not like the strong vinegar taste. 
         There is no vinegar called for in this recipe. I recommend they try it again, but with apple cider this time, and believe they will really enjoy it!</p>
