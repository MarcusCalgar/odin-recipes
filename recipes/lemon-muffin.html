    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grated lemon peel adds flavor to this basic muffin recipe for citrus-accented homemade muffins you can achieve quickly and easily.</p>
    <p>I am 7 years old and my family and I really liked this recipe. We added 1 tsp vanilla extract, lemon juice and lemon zest from a lemon. I would recommend this to anyone who loves baking, but advise them to make the same changes, it makes a difference.</p>
